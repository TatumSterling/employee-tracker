## Description
Hi! My name is Tatum Sterling, and this is my content management systems application. This application was designed to allow management to view, and update current departments, roles and employees. I challenged myself by creating this simple database application from scratch that utilizes user input from the command line to update mySQL database with queries. I used javascript, inquirer and mySQL to create an interactive application that can carry out different commands
        
## Installation
npm i inquirer
npm i mysql2
npm i dotenv

        
## Usage
To use this application, clone the code then install anything necessary from the installation section. From there, open your terminal and run the index.js and you will be given a few command options for the employee database. 
        
## License
please refer to LICENSE in the repo
         
## Tests
There is currently no testing for this application
